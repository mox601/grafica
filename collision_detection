You model each wall and floor as a plane 
and then just take the dot product of the camera position with the normal of the plane. 
If this comes out negative you are behind the wall, 
and then you move the camera back out so it isn't penetrating. 
The problem with this method though is that if you are already behind a wall 
and touch it, you will pop through it. 
A certain amount of fudging is required to get it to work properly!
